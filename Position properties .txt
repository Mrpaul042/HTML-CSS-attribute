Position properties
need: even through if you have top, left bottom, or right  which can be used to place/align  the elements in the web page 
Now On what basis they have to be placed ??.......
1.static
2.relative
3.absolute
4.fixed 
5.sticky

1.static:They are not affected by top ,left, bottom or right
By default all the html elements are positioned static 


2.relative:
a.They are  affected by top ,left, bottom or right
b.A space is created for them in the document
c.It will affect the document flow

3.absolute
a.They are  affected by top ,left, bottom or right 
b.It will affect the document flow
c.no space is created 
d.it will be positioned w.r.t first positioned element


2 cases are there
absolute position property has to be used along with the combination of the relative
ex:if child1has to be absolute means 


4.fixed : IF you allot one specific location top,left, bottom, or right 
they are not affected by scrolling

5.sticky:
they will get affected by scrolling , but.. if you reach their position they will stick on to it
